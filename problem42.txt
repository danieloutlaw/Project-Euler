t(n) = [n(n+1)]/2 <-- formula for traingle numbers

converting each letter into a number corresponding to the alphabetical postion and adding the numbers we get the score.

1. Make an array of all the words
2. Make an array of all the traingle numbers that could possibly be a word (say 25*26=650 max)
3. Give each word a score and see if it is a triangle number
